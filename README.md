# 100 Days Python Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days Python Challenge repository! In this repository, I've documented my journey as I progressed through the 100-day Python programming challenge led by Dr. Angela Yu.

## About the Challenge

The 100 Days of Code challenge is a commitment to code for at least an hour every day for 100 days. It's an excellent way to build consistency, improve coding skills, and work on personal projects.

## Instructor: Dr. Angela Yu

Dr. Angela Yu is an amazing instructor who has guided me through this challenging yet rewarding journey. Her teaching method is comprehensive, engaging, and easy to follow. I owe much of my progress to her expertise and guidance.

## Progress Summary

### Day 1-10:

- Learned the basics of Python programming language.
- Covered topics such as variables, data types, control flow, and functions.
- Completed numerous exercises to solidify my understanding of the fundamentals.

### Day 11-17:

- Explored more advanced Python concepts including object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, and error handling.
- Practiced solving coding challenges and implementing algorithms.
- Dived into using external libraries and packages to enhance my projects.

## Final Project: Snake Game

For my final project, I decided to challenge myself by building a Snake Game using the pygame package. The game includes features such as:
- Classic snake gameplay with user controls.
- Sound effects to enhance the gaming experience.
- Score tracking and game over detection.
- Customizable settings and difficulty levels.
